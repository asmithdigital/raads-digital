The first step is to determine which [theme]({{site.baseurl}}/foundations/themes) you will be using for your project. 

## Default

The default theme is the base for all items in the Apiary design system. The default theme is used by insurance web applications such as QTB, renewals and claims.

## Portal

The portal theme inherits from the default theme. The portal theme contains variations to the Apiary design system such as layout, components, and forms. These variations are referenced for each relevant item in the Apiary design system.
