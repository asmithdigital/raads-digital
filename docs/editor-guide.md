Log in and then go here https://github.com/asmithdigital/raads-digital, then navigate to the 'docs' directory.

All the pages live in the docs directory, even this guide. You will notice that this guide page isn't in the menu, we will come back to that in a minute.

The first thing you want to do is pick a page you want to edit... Say buttons https://github.com/asmithdigital/raads-digital/blob/main/docs/components/buttons.md

You will notice an index.md file in that same directory, I'll come back to that in a minute as well. For now, just think about the buttons.md page. .md stands for Markdown. It's an HTML preprocessor. Its a very basic way to write HTML. The build tools will then generate HTML from the markdown, but you don't need to think about that, it's behind-the-scenes magic.

First, you need to click the edit button 'Edit in place' or click the pencil icon. Don't click open with github.dev or Github Desktop. That's just confusing. Just edit it in place.

Now, make some changes... add some markdown... go crazy...

Then click commit changes. Thats the same as saying save, except its in git terminology. You can give your commit a title and a short description. You can think of this as adding a line to a changelog because thats exactly what it does. You can see a history of all commits in the commit history.

Now, go to the page, give it a few minutes, then refresh and it should update within 5-10 minutes.
