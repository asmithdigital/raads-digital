## Insurance (default)

The default theme is the base for all items in the Apiary design system. It uses the default state of the grid system, components and forms, and is used by insurance web applications such as QTB, renewals and claims.

## My Account

The My Account theme inherits from the default theme. It contains variations to the defaults for the grid system, components, and forms, which are unique to the My Account application.
