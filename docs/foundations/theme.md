**The following themes are available within Apiary:**
1. **Default:** Used by Insurance web applications such as QTB, renewals and claims. It is the base for all elements in the Apiary design system.
1. **Portal:** Used by the My Account web application. It inherits from the default theme and contains style variations that are specific only to My Account.

Each item in Apiary will reference its theme...

Next: review the Apiary [Foundations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/foundations/), [Components]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/components/), and [Forms]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/forms/).
